/**
 * Encapsulates either an analysis result score or the aggregate score of Content. 
 * A score measures how likely the Content object is to be relevant to an investigation.
 * Relevance is determined by a series of analysis techniques, each of which has a score. 
 * The aggregate score for an item is then determined based on its analysis results.
 *
 * A score has two primary fields: Significance and Confidence. Significance is based on 
 * what the analysis technique is measuring and if its goal is to detect good, bad, or 
 * suspicious. The significance is more about the technique and less about a specific
 * implementation of the technique. 
 * Confidence reflects how confident the analysis technique implementation was in its conclusion
 * and is based on the false positive rate of that implementation. 
 *
 * Let's first look at a made up example. Lets say that in some crazy world, we
 * can detect if a car is "bad" based on its color and we have a module to look for
 * green convertibles. This module's significance is based on how many green 
 * convertibles are bad overall. If all green convertibles are bad, then its 
 * significance will be HIGH because the car's existence is surely notable. But, if
 * there are some good and some bad, then it should have a significance of MEDIUM (or LOW).
 * Any module that detects green convertibles should have the same significance. 
 * But, different modules may have different confidences based on their approach. 
 * If a module can accurately detect a green convertible, then it should have HIGH
 * confidence. But, if a module can't differentiate a convertible from a truck or
 * green from yellow, then it should have MEDIUM confience (or lower). 
 * 
 * For a more traditional example, if a file is found in a MD5 hashset of notable files, 
 * then it would get HIGH significance because the hashset contains only known notable
 * files. And it would get HIGH confidence because the MD5 calculation and lookup 
 * process are exact matches and there is no guessing.
 *
 * For a keyword hit, the significance could be MEDIUM if the word exists in both
 * good and bad contexts, but the confidence would be HIGH because we know the word 
 * existed in a document. 
 * 
 * If a file is found to be on a good list, then it could have a significance of NONE
 * and then other modules could ignore it. 
 * The confidence could be HIGH if it was based on an exact match MD5 or MEDIUM if it 
 * was based on only file name and size and we aren't entirely sure what the content was.
